\section*{Introduction}

\par \bigskip
\noindent Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive and universally fatal neurologic condition characterized by cognitive and motor dysfunction\cite{NatRev}. Prior research on CJD in the US demonstrated a stable incidence from 1979 - 2006, though recent trends are not well described\cite{PLoSOne}. The incidence of sporadic CJD (sCJD), the most common variant of CJD, is higher among older patients\cite{JNuerol}. Due to demographic trends worldwide towards increasing aging populations, the epidemiology of CJD is evolving\cite{SciRep}. In this study we examined extended death certificate data from 2007 - 2020 in order to better understand current trends of CJD in the US.

\section*{Methods}

\par \bigskip

\noindent This study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER database\cite{CDCWonder}. ICD-10 codes on death certificates were used from 2007 - 2020, additional notes are provided in the \textbf{Supplemental Materials}. Given the clinical course of CJD, many studies suggest death certificates are an accurate measure of incidence\cite{NeuroEpi}. Provisional data was not included for analysis. 

\par \bigskip

\noindent Joinpoint regression modeling (using the National Cancer Institute’s Joinpoint Regression Program \cite{StatMed, Joinpoint}, version 4.9.1.0), was used to identify and characterize inflection points in trends as well as average annual percent change (AAPC). A Weighted BIC analysis model with estimates for first-order autocorrelation was fit to longitudinal data to pull crude and age-adjusted annual percentage changes across a range of demographic groups; see \textbf{Table \ref{table:joinpoint-analysis}}. Additionally, t-tests were performed to determine significance of changes at the beginning and end of the study period, defined as 2-sided $p < .05$. These analyses were conducted in Stata, version 18.0 (StataCorp). This study was determined to not constitute human subjects research by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board.

\section*{Results}

Mortality attributed to CJD has risen consistently in recent years. Males saw an increase from 150 deaths and a crude mortality rate of 0.101 [95\% CI 0.085-0.118] in 2007 to 226 deaths and a crude mortality rate of 0.139 [95\% CI 0.121-0.157] in 2020 ($p = 0.0022$). Females saw a greater increase from 153 deaths and crude mortality rate of 0.100 [95\% CI 0.084-0.116] to 250 deaths and crude mortality rate of 0.150 [95\% CI 0.131-0.168] across the same time period ($p = 0.0001$); see \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:crude_deaths_by_gender}}. This increase in mortality rate is not significant in males when the results are age-adjusted; increasing from 0.100 [95\% CI 0.083-0.116] to 0.111 [95\% CI 0.096-0.126] ($p = 0.3370$). However, the increase remains significant in females with age-adjustment increasing from 0.83 [95\% CI 0.069-0.096] to 0.112 [95\% CI 0.098-0.126] for females ($p = 0.0036$); see \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:age_adj_deaths_by_gender}}. 

\par \bigskip

\noindent Individual age groups were evaluated across this time period with the largest increase in crude mortality rate in the cohort aged 75-84 years. This finding was not statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level in males, increasing from 0.519 [95\% CI 0.345-0.750] to 0.678 [95\% CI 0.502-0.897] ($p = 0.2484$); see \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:male_age_specific_deaths}}. The same trend held in females, increasing from 0.312 [95\% CI 0.200-0.464] to 0.477 [95\% CI 0.346-0.640] ($p = 0.0866$); see \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:female_age_specific_deaths}}.

\par \bigskip

\noindent Joinpoint trend analysis revealed a steady increase in the crude mortality rate for both males (3.0 AAPC [95\% CI 2.4-3.7]) and females (3.6 AAPC [95\% CI 2.4-4.7]) overall. This trend decreased, but remained significant after age adjustment. Among the age groups examined, those aged 65-74 years exhibited a significant increase in crude mortality rate (1.5 AAPC [95\% CI 0.6-2.4]), as did those aged 55-64 (1.7 AAPC [95\% CI 0.6-2.9]); see \textbf{Table \ref{table:joinpoint-analysis}}.

\section*{Discussion}
 
\par \bigskip
\noindent Our findings demonstrate that the incidence of CJD has risen considerably in recent years in the US, disproportionately affecting older patients and female patients. These results align closely with recent data from Japan and may be largely attributed to demographic changes in recent years\cite{SciRep}. Our study’s main limitation is a reliance on death certificate data for estimating CJD incidence.

\par \bigskip
\noindent This data may be subject to miscoding or misdiagnosis, though existing research supports the use of death certificates for understanding CJD epidemiology\cite{NeuroEpi}. This analysis underscores the changing landscape of CJD in the US in recent years and suggests a need for close surveillance among the aging US population.
